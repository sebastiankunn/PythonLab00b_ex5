# PythonLab00b_ex5
last batch of basic exercises to get comfy with Python, this time I'm practicing with JSON
1. Write a Python program to convert JSON data to Python objects.
2. Write a Python program to convert Python objects (dictionary) to JSON
data.
3. Write a Python program to convert Python objects into JSON strings.
Print all the values.
4. Write a Python program to convert Python dictionary objects (sort by
key) to JSON data. Print the object members with indent level 4.
5. Write a Python program to create a new JSON file from an existing JSON
file. Use the included json file ’states.json’ and create a new json file that
does not contain the ’area code’ field.
